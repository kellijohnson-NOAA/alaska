1. Find the true mean weight and standard deviation of cod because 
the data is given in in CPUE, which makes the weight not a true weight.
2. Simplify the simulation. JTT does not think that 
2. Make sure equations are the same as JTT equations.
   - I believe I am using his code, but I should double check.
3. gstat: a spatial r package that will facilitate mapping of spatial predictions using a inverse linear distance kriging algorithm.
4. Plot the mean log abundance for each stock behind the plot for the overall mean log abundance, I am going to have to change what is placed in the report, to get at the predicted abundance for each station in a given year.
6. Read: Lindgren F, Rue H, Lindström J. 2011. An explicit link between Gaussian fields and Gaussian Markov random fields: the stochastic partial differential equation approach [with discussion]. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 73(4):423–98.
7. Get NOAA JISAO contribution number.
8. @Mueter2005 can be used as a reference for which justification exits to
remove years prior to 1993 in the analysis because of a lack of standardized gear.
Also, @Meuter2005 suggest trawls with a performance of satisfactory should be the only
trawls included in the analysis. Not sure how to find out which trawls are and are
not satisfactory.
9. Rerun the analysis with the SE Alaska no-trawl zone kept in
