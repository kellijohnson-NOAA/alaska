<li>Multiple observations at a single station in a given year.</li>
<li>Rerun the analysis using counts of zero but add a small constant to the zero values and see if this changes the results.</li>
<li>Ask Jim about the likelihood to see if it is correct.</li>
<li>Create different stock structures based on triangulation matrices. Then use model selection to choose the most likely triangulation matrix.</li>
<li>Read: Lindgren F, Rue H, Lindström J. 2011. An explicit link between Gaussian fields and Gaussian Markov random fields: the stochastic partial differential equation approach [with discussion]. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 73(4):423–98.</li>
<li>rpart: an r package that will use multivariate partitioning to delineate between stocks by minimizing the sum of the variances for whatever metrics that you give it.</li>
<li>gstat: a spatial r package that will facilitat mapping of spatial predictions using a inverse linear distance kriging algorithm.</li>
<li>Check JISAO funding project number.</li>
<li>Get NOAA JISAO contribution number.</li>
