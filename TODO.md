1. Rerun the analysis using counts of zero but add a small constant to the zero values and see if this changes the results.
4. Make sure equations are the same as JTT equations.
9. gstat: a spatial r package that will facilitate mapping of spatial predictions using a inverse linear distance kriging algorithm.
11. Plot the mean log abundance for each stock behind the plot for the overall mean log abundance, I am going to have to change what is placed in the report, to get at the predicted abundance for each station in a given year.
13. Check the pruning algorithm.
7. Read: Lindgren F, Rue H, Lindström J. 2011. An explicit link between Gaussian fields and Gaussian Markov random fields: the stochastic partial differential equation approach [with discussion]. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 73(4):423–98.
10. Check JISAO funding project number.
10. Get NOAA JISAO contribution number.
