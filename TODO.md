===============================================================================

1. Rerun the analysis using counts of zero but add a small constant to the zero values and see if this changes the results.
    * Find a way to use data.zero and spatially reference each point on the mesh such that I can rerun the model with a small constant added to all zero tows.
    * Look at the effect of the non-zero constant.
2. Make sure equations are the same as JTT equations.
3. gstat: a spatial r package that will facilitate mapping of spatial predictions using a inverse linear distance kriging algorithm.
4. Plot the mean log abundance for each stock behind the plot for the overall mean log abundance, I am going to have to change what is placed in the report, to get at the predicted abundance for each station in a given year.
5. Check the pruning algorithm.
6. Read: Lindgren F, Rue H, Lindström J. 2011. An explicit link between Gaussian fields and Gaussian Markov random fields: the stochastic partial differential equation approach [with discussion]. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 73(4):423–98.
7. Get NOAA JISAO contribution number.
8. @Mueter2005 can be used as a reference for which justification exits to
remove years prior to 1993 in the analysis because of a lack of standardized gear.
Also, @Meuter2005 suggest trawls with a performance of satisfactory should be the only
trawls included in the analysis. Not sure how to find out which trawls are and are
not satisfactory.
