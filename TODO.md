===============================================================================

1. Multiple observations at a single station in a given year.
2. Rerun the analysis using counts of zero but add a small constant to the zero values and see if this changes the results.
3. Ask Jim about the likelihood to see if it is correct.
7. Read: Lindgren F, Rue H, Lindström J. 2011. An explicit link between Gaussian fields and Gaussian Markov random fields: the stochastic partial differential equation approach [with discussion]. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 73(4):423–98.
8. rpart: multivariate partitioning to delineate between stocks by minimizing the sum of the variances for whatever metrics that you give it.
9. gstat: a spatial r package that will facilitate mapping of spatial predictions using a inverse linear distance kriging algorithm.
10. Check JISAO funding project number.
10. Get NOAA JISAO contribution number.
11. Plot the mean log abundance for each stock behind the plot for the overall mean log abundance, I am going to have to change what is placed in the report, to get at the predicted abundance for each station in a given year.
12. Change how the model references the first year, which is the percent of equilibrium, right now it is predicting 25 years when I only have 24 years of data.
